					<p class="nomargin">Ferring was born in 1950 in two modest rooms in Malmö, Sweden. Dr Frederik Paulsen, Ferring’s founder, had a breakthrough idea: to create medicines on the body’s own terms, using peptide hormones produced by the pituitary gland to treat a range of health conditions. Today, Ferring is one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies, pioneering life-changing treatments in a few key areas, including reproductive health. Over the decades, our team has cultivated a deep appreciation for people’s unique experiences and continually seeks new ways to understand and support each individual’s fertility journey. Through research and strategic initiatives, we’re working relentlessly to expand access to fertility treatments and provide support for anyone who needs help building their family.</p>
